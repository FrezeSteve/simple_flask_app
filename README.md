# simple_flask_app
A simple flask application. This is the most simplest form of flask application.
Its a starter template.
implemented various techniques:
one being using blueprints. another is making sure the models and views are separated from the main app
so that when the application grows you can still be comfortable debugging.Another module included is the flask
migration which allows you to track your model changes and migrate them to existing database in production.
Added blueprint to the flask restful package.
Was able to adjust the organization of the project files to fit the ever growing views that will handle 
both logic and valdation of the application.
